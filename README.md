## Shrek
### In markdown
* Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by Love's first kiss.
*  She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed.
* She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. Like that's ever going to happen. What a loony. Shrek 
  * Beware Stay out I think he's in here. All right. Lets get it! Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains.
  * Well actually that would be a giant. Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse. They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin.

Next part of the Shrek script:

> Right, this one is full. Take it away. Give me that. Your fine days are over. -25 pieces of silver for the witch. Next. -Come on. Sit  down there! And be quiet! This cage is so small. You wouldn't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change.
> Please, give me another chance. Oh, shut up! Next. What do we got? This little wooden puppet. I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy.

\*I promise I'm not going crazy, this is all a joke, don't be concerned for my mental health\*
